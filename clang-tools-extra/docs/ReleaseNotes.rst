Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Extra Clang Tools, part of the
Clang release 11.0.0. Here we describe the status of the Extra Clang Tools in
some detail, including major improvements from the previous release and new
feature work. All LLVM releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web
site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

What's New in Extra Clang Tools 11.0.0?
=======================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed
here. Generic improvements to Extra Clang Tools as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Improvements to clangd
----------------------

Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Eliminated long delays after adding/removing includes ("async preambles")

- Faster indexing

- Less memory used to index headers used by open files ("dynamic index")

- Many requests are implicitly cancelled rather than queued when the file is
  edited, preventing a backlog

- Background indexing can be selectively disabled per-path through config

Selecting and targeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved understanding and selection around broken code ("recovery AST")

- Operations like "go-to-definition" will target things on the left of the
  cursor, if there is nothing eligible on the right.

- Arguments to ``assert()``-like macros can be properly selected.

Diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^

- When a header is saved, diagnostics for files that use it are updated.

- Calls ``std::make_unique`` produce diagnostics for the constructor call.
  (Template functions *in general* are not expanded for performance reasons).

- Diagnostics update more quickly for files that build quickly (no 500ms delay)

- Automatic fixes are offered even when they affect macro arguments.

- Warnings from included headers are not shown (but errors still are).

- A handful of high-quality clang-tidy checks are enabled by default:

  - readability-misleading-indentation,

  - readability-deleted-default,

  - bugprone-integer-division,

  - bugprone-sizeof-expression,

  - bugprone-suspicious-missing-comma,

  - bugprone-unused-raii,

  - bugprone-unused-return-value,

  - misc-unused-using-decls,

  - misc-unused-alias-decls,

  - misc-definitions-in-headers

Refactorings
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Rename applies across the project, using the index.

- Accuracy of rename improved in many places.

- New refactoring: add using declaration for qualified name.

- New refactoring: move function definition out-of-line.

Code completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Function call parentheses are not inserted if they already exist.

- Completion of ``#include`` filenames triggers earlier (after ``<``, ``"``, and
  ``/``) and is less aggressive about replacing existing text.

- Documentation is reflowed in the same way as on hover.

Go-to-definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Dependent names in templates may be heuristically resolved

- Identifiers in comments may be resolved using other occurrences in the file
  or in the index.

- Go-to-definition on an ``override`` or ``final`` specifier jumps to the
  overridden method.

Hover
^^^^^

- Expressions passed as function arguments show parameter name, conversions etc.

- Members now include the access specifier in the displayed declaration.

- Classes and fields show memory layout information (size and offset).

- Somewhat improved understanding of formatting in documentation comments.

- Trivial inline getters/setters are implicitly documented as such.

Highlighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The ``semanticTokens`` protocol from LSP 3.16 is supported.
  (Only token types are exposed, no modifiers yet).

- The non-standard ``textDocument/semanticHighlighting`` notification is
  deprecated and will be removed in clangd 12.

- Placing the cursor on a control flow keyword highlights related flow
  (e.g. ``break`` -> ``for``).

Language support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- clangd features now work inside templates on windows.
  (MSVC-compatible delayed-template-parsing is no longer used).

- Objective-C properties can be targeted and cross-references are indexed.

- Field names in designated initializers (C++20) can be targeted, and code
  completion works in many cases.

- ``goto`` labels: go-to-defintion, cross-references, and rename all work.

- Concepts (C++20): go-to-definition on concept names, and some limited code
  completion support for concept members.

System integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The project index is now written to ``$PROJECT/.cache/clangd/index``.
  ``$PROJECT/.clangd`` is now expected to be a configuration file.

  Old ``$PROJECT/.clangd`` directories can safely be deleted.

  We recommend including both ``.cache/`` and ``.clangd/`` (with trailing slash)
  in ``.gitignore``, for backward-compatibility with earlier releases of clangd.

- For non-project files (those without a compilation database), the index
  location better reflects OS conventions:

  - ``%LocalAppData%\clangd\index`` on Windows

  - ``$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/clangd/index`` on Mac

  - ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/clangd/index`` or ``~/.cache/clangd/index`` on others

  Old ``~/.clangd/index`` directories can safely be deleted.

- clangd now reads configuration from ``.clangd`` files inside your project,
  and from a user configuration file in an OS-specific location:

  - ``%LocalAppData%\clangd\config.yaml`` on Windows

  - ``~/Library/Preferences/clangd/config.yaml`` on Mac

  - ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clangd/config.yaml`` or ``~/.config/clangd/config.yaml``
    on others

  See `clangd configuration format <https://clangd.llvm.org/config.html>`_.

- clangd will search for compilation databases (``compile_commands.json``) in
  a ``build/`` subdirectory, as well as in the project root.
  This follows CMake conventions, avoiding the need for a symlink in many cases.

- Compile flags can be selectively modified per-path, using configuration.

- Improved filtering of unhelpful compile flags (such as those relating to
  pre-compiled headers).

- Improved detection of standard library headers location.

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Background indexing status is reported using LSP 3.15 progress events
  (``window/workDoneProgress/create``).

- Infrastructure for gathering internal metrics.
  (Off by default, set ``$CLANGD_METRICS`` to generate a named CSV file).

- Document versions are now tracked, version is reported along with diagnostics.

- Too many stability and correctness fixes to mention.

  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-con54-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con54-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl37-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl37-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl51-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl51-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-str34-c

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`performance-faster-string-find
  <clang-tidy/checks/performance-faster-string-find>` check.

  Now checks ``std::basic_string_view`` by default.

- Improved :doc:`readability-else-after-return
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-else-after-return>` check now supports a
  `WarnOnConditionVariables` option to control whether to refactor condition
  variables where possible.

- Improved :doc:`readability-identifier-naming
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-identifier-naming>` check.

  Now able to rename member references in class template definitions with
  explicit access.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-string-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-string-init>` check now supports a
  `StringNames` option enabling its application to custom string classes. The
  check now detects in class initializers and constructor initializers which
  are deemed to be redundant.

- Checks supporting the ``HeaderFileExtensions`` flag now support ``;`` as a
  delimiter in addition to ``,``, with the latter being deprecated as of this
  release. This simplifies how one specifies the options on the command line:
  ``--config="{CheckOptions: [{ key: HeaderFileExtensions, value: h;;hpp;hxx }]}"``

- Improved :doc:`readability-qualified-auto
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-qualified-auto>` check now supports a
  `AddConstToQualified` to enable adding ``const`` qualifiers to variables
  typed with ``auto *`` and ``auto &``.

Renamed checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The 'fuchsia-restrict-system-headers' check was renamed to :doc:`portability-restrict-system-includes
  <clang-tidy/checks/portability-restrict-system-includes>`

Other improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- For `run-clang-tidy.py` add option to use alpha checkers from
  `clang-analyzer`.
